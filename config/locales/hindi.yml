  carproof_heading1: "WHAT IS CARPROOF?"
  carproof_point1: "CarProof® is a Canadian company that supplies vehicle history reports that contain important Canadian and U.S.-based information. CarProof provides consumers with real-time vehicle history data including lien data from across the country (with enforceable lien guarantee), verifiable odometer records, branding information (salvage, stolen, non-repairable, rebuilt, etc.), import and export records, collision estimate information as well as accident claims data from Canada’s public and private insurers.<br /><br />In addition to thousands of car dealers and private individuals across Canada, major vehicle manufacturers are using CarProof to support their off-lease and certified pre-owned programs. CarProof is also endorsed by insurance companies, provincial automobile associations, motor dealer councils, national auto auctions, consumer protection groups and law enforcement."
  carproof_heading2: "WHAT’S SO SPECIAL ABOUT A CARPROOF REPORT?"
  carproof_point2: "-	CarProof® is electronically connected on a real-time (“live”) basis to its data sources. This means that the data is always current and not outdated. Other services purchase data dumps periodically, leaving the chance that recent important data is not included in their reports.<br />-	CarProof provides consumers with Canadian lien and/or security interest information on vehicles from right across Canada and guarantees the results. CarProof is connected live to each provincial and territorial registrar responsible for maintaining these records. Other U.S.-based services (including CARFAX), do not report any Canadian vehicle lien information.<br />-	CarProof is the only vehicle history report available in English and French.<br />-	CarProof provides consumers with Canadian insurance and accident claims data. Through their live connection to comprehensive databases that service the Canadian insurance industry, CarProof provides data from Canada's private and public insurers. For vehicles in or from British Columbia, CarProof VERIFIED BC reports provide additional claims information directly from the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) database.<br />-	In addition to all of the above, CarProof reports also provide consumers with data from one of the largest U.S.-based vehicle history services, Experian Automotive. Through their live connection to Experian’s 2 billion+ record database, all CarProof reports include the data you would get from other popular U.S.-based vehicle history services, including a Lemon Search."
  carproof_heading3: "WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU?"
  carproof_point3: "Simply put, CarProof® supplies the most comprehensive vehicle history report available to Canadian consumers. The fact that the vehicle you are interested in comes with a CarProof report means that you can be confident in the integrity of the vehicle, thereby allowing you to buy with confidence."
